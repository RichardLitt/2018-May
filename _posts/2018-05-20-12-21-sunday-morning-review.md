I feel like I've done nothing this morning. I've been sitting in front of my computer, fiddling with various bits of open source work. To make myself feel a bit better, I figured I would write out what I've done here:

- I've merged [a long-standing PR](https://github.com/btford/write-good/pull/87) to add CLI help to [write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good);
- I've closed all of the remaining issues on [low-resource-languages](https://github.com/RichardLitt/low-resource-languages), which included searching through the ACL wiki at length, and also making high-level decisions about the list;
- I've added a footnote to my thesis about the ACL Wiki's quality, which I didn't fully know about before;
- I've fixed all of the tests for [ships-log](https://github.com/RichardLitt/ships-log), updated all of the dependencies, and learned more about Promises, `afterEach`, and Mocha;
- I've triaged and generally reviewed around 100 open issues on GitHub, reaching notification 0 there;
- I've read some newsletters and sorted my email;
- I've reported fraud on my credit card and ordered a new one;
- I've had a cup of coffee.

All told, this is actually a lot of work. The piecemeal nature of it makes it seem like nothing, but this is the sort of work that builds and leads to goals being realised. One morning spent closing these issues isn't so bad - this is the first time in years I've had nothing specifically labelled to do on low-resource-languages, for instance.

I'm going to pat myself on the back and go for lunch.
