Well, a couple of hours later, and I have [audit-templates](https://github.com/mntnr/audit-templates) published and working just fine. I also fixed some bugs in [covenant-generator](https://github.com/simonv3/covenant-generator) related to the cli and creating subdirectories as needed. Feels good to get my hands dirty with some code.

I'm highly tempted to make audit-templates automatically fill out the template for things that I know are in there. But that's not really the point of the module - the point is to print out a template for an audit, not to start filling it. I think I'll hold back, because I don't want to spend a ton of time creating tools that I can do manually faster. Think smarter.
