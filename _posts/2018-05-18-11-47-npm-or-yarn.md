I use `npm install` often when programming. And... I don't actually know what yarn does. I wonder if I am being inefficient.

I remember hearing that npm5 actually solved a lot of the problems that Yarn was made to address. So, I've just googled that, and found [this article](https://blog.risingstack.com/yarn-vs-npm-node-js-package-managers/).

>    - it does not send package usage information to Facebook (yarn uses Facebook’s npm registry mirror)

Well, that solves that problem. Let's keep going with npm. I wish there was better content addressing with npm, where it would keep a copy somewhere in my harddrive and then pull from there for versions I already have. I don't know if someone has done this yet with IPFS, but it sounds like a tool that would make sense. I should ask David Dias or Jeromy.
