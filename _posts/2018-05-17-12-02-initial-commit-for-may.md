I've set up the blog again for this month. I miss writing in public, and I let myself lapse with [the April blog](https://richardlitt.github.io/2018-april/) after working single-mindedly on my thesis for so long. Now that that is mostly over (I'm still waiting for some reviews), let's get back into the habit of writing and thinking in public.

A note on the process of setting this up: I used the newly created [monthly-blog](https://github.com/RichardLitt/monthly-blog) template and [this util script](https://github.com/RichardLitt/utils/blob/master/create-monthly-blog.sh) to set this blog up.
