Now that I know that I have some money coming in for the summer and that I'll be OK for contracts for the next few months, keeping an excessive amount of savings seems odd and counterproductive. I can save later.

I just paid off another student loan. Goodbye, $4000 federal loan. That leaves another $4k federal loan, and then two quite a bit larger ones (roughly $45k each). The two larger loans are higher interest, but I want to see clear progress, and I want to whittle down my monthly payments. And, every time I get rid of a loan, I feel just a little bit more free. That's more important than anything else.
